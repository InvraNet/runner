# Runner

## Why was this application made?
The developer was bored one day and cooked up something in his visual studio.

# How do I use this application?
Just like normal run (Win + R), type in what you want to be executing, e.g. ms-settings:, then hit Enter, or Run, and to run as administrator hit Alt + E (Standing for elevate) or the "Run as Administrator." check box.
